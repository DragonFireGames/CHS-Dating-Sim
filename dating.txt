Black - Elena Cruz - senioritis (kinda just burnt out with school, cynical towards society & humanity)
Pink - Amanda Bennett - energetic (has performance anxiety and is lonely, feels like she puts on a mask around others that she takes off while at band)
Red - Valentina Reyes - tsundere (yeah, pushes away her love interest though she craves him)
Blonde - Skylar Brooks - ice queen (struggles with body image and self acceptance, compares herself to social media)
Brown - Maya Higgins - shy nerd (shy closet perv with a keen sense of wit when she gets to know you)
